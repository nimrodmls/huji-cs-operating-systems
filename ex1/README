Assignment 1
The WhatIDo program first creates a new directory named 'Welcome', under the
current directory, as seen with the mkdir syscall. 
Upon creation of the new directory, there are 3 consequent calls to openat
syscall which triggers file creation. The 3 files are created under the newly
created 'Welcome' directroy and are these files are named 
(in the order of creation): 'Welcome', 'To', 'OS-2024'.
Following the 3 file creations, there are 3 consequent file writing syscalls
as seen with the 'write' syscall. These write syscalls are called once for each
of the files the program created earlier, and in the same order, though with
different contents: The first writes 'If you haven't read the course guidelines
yet --- do it right now!'. The second writes 'Start exercises early!'. The third
writes 'Good luck!'.
After the 3 write-file syscalls, the program removes with the 'unlink' syscall
the 3 files the program created earlier - again, in the same order of creation.
And by that, the program finishes.
